        <p>I have been in manufacturing for over 15 years and I have always loved art and creating something with my hands. That could have been a pencil sketch,
            to building the deck attached to my house. Manufacturing was the best place for my appeal to art, creating a working product from a drawing to a 3D model
            to taking raw material and shaping it to the drawing. Now my latest hobby was 3D printing and that is another form of
            art but a different process then the CNC machines I am used to using. (These images are just samples of what 3D printing
            is and what someone can do with it.) I have been reading code for CNC machines and now 3D printers, which was not much different.
            But the process of how these items are made are total opposites, subtractive manufacturing to additive manufacturing. Reading code was the same,
            just a few differences from machine to machine, it is just like the difference between coding languages of Python and JavaScript. Syntax is slighty different
            but the structure is there and all the content in between is your art coming to life. </p>
